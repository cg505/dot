# kotct/dot

Dot is a collective configuration system which contains configurations for programs like Emacs and zsh, but also (potentially) Vim.
Dot is written under the following principles:

* Configurations should only be run if necessary&mdash;that is, if the *user* wants it.
* Configurations should be as lean and modular as possible, utilizing autoload and byte compilation mechanisms whenever possible.
* Configurations should be clean, well-documented, and consistently written throughout.
* Configurations should have a focus on excellent support for everything.
* Configurations should also have clear error messages handling common PEBKAC errors.
