# kotct/dot

Dot is a collective configuration system which contains configurations for programs like Emacs and zsh, but also (potentially) Vim.
Dot is written under the following principles:

* Configurations should only be run if necessary&mdash;that is, if the *user* wants it.
* Configurations should be as lean and modular as possible, utilizing autoload and byte compilation mechanisms whenever possible.
* Configurations should be clean, well-documented, and consistently written throughout.
* Configurations should have a focus on excellent support for everything.
* Configurations should also have clear error messages handling common PEBKAC errors.

## Emacs

The Emacs configuration is the primary focus of this project and is the defining feature of this project.
Most of the work done here will be done on the Emacs configuration, as the primary goal in writing this configuration is and was to write a robust, fast, and efficient Emacs configuration.
