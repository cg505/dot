# Contributing to Dot

Dot is a welcoming project, and we welcome the suggestions of all.
However, certain types of contributions are more valuable than others.

In general, here's a suggested workflow:

1. Fork `dot` to your user or organization account.

2. Clone your fork of this repository onto your machine.

3. Create a new feature branch for *one specific change that you wish
   to make*.

4. Make your desired changes, testing and committing often.

5. Create a pull request once you have made your changes and committed
   them.

6. Actively participate in your pull request&mdash;if the maintainers
   ask for a revision to your proposed changes, make it promptly to
   keep them happy.
