# Contributing to Dot

Dot is a welcoming project, and we welcome the suggestions of all.
However, certain types of contributions are more valuable than others.

In general, here's a suggested workflow:

1. Fork `dot` to your user or organization account.

2. Clone your fork onto your machine.

3. Create a new feature branch for *one specific change that you wish to make*.

4. Create a pull request once you have made your changes and pushed them.

5. Actively participate in your pull request&mdash;if the maintainers
   ask for a change, make it.
